# Crypto Price Tracker ‚Äì Full Stack Developer Challenge

## üìã Objective

This challenge is designed to evaluate your skills as a full stack developer using .NET 6 (C#), Entity Framework Core, Razor Pages, and REST API integration.

You'll be working with a project that simulates tracking cryptocurrency prices using the CoinGecko API.

---

## üß† What You Need to Do

### ‚úÖ 1. Fix the Service Logic

- Open `CryptoPriceService.cs` and fix the logic so it correctly:
  - Fetches coin data from CoinGecko for all existing coins  
    Documentation: https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/introduction
  - Handles async operations properly
  - Prevents duplicate entries
  - Saves the results to the SQLite database

  ‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter duplicate entries or errors from the CoinGecko API, decide how to handle them.  
  You're free to choose the best approach ‚Äî just make sure you explain your reasoning in a short code comment.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Some files may have outdated or incorrect `namespace` declarations. Please review and update them as needed to ensure consistency across the project.

### ‚úÖ 2. Complete the Controller

- Open `CryptoController.cs` and:
  - Complete the `POST /api/crypto/update-prices` endpoint
  - Add a `GET /api/crypto/latest-prices` endpoint to return the most recent price per asset. All available cryptocoins must be saved.

### ‚úÖ 3. Test the Razor Frontend

- The view in `/Views/Home/Index.cshtml` includes a button to call the API.
- Ensure that the interface provides clear feedback to the user indicating whether the update succeeded or failed.

### ‚úÖ 4. Create the Frontend Visualization in `Index.cshtml`

Build a clean and user-friendly visualization directly in the existing Razor view:  
**`/Views/Home/Index.cshtml`**

This page must:

- Display **each cryptocurrency asset** with at least the following fields:
  - ‚úÖ **Name**
  - ‚úÖ **Symbol**
  - ‚úÖ **Current Price**
  - ‚úÖ **Currency**
  - ‚úÖ **Icon**
    - Add the `IconUrl` property to the `CryptoAsset` model
    - Retrieve the image url from CoinGecko
    - Save it to the database
  - ‚úÖ **Last Updated**
    - This value must be converted to the client's local timezone using JavaScript
  - ‚úÖ **Trend**
    - Add a visual indicator showing whether the price has increased, decreased, or stayed the same compared to the previous saved price (e.g., üîº, üîΩ, ‚ûñ)
    - Optionally, include the percentage change

- Use the existing "Update Prices" button to trigger the API and refresh the data displayed in the view.

> üéØ **Goal:** The user should be able to open the page, see the most recent cryptocurrency data clearly presented, and update it with one click.

> üí° Bonus points for improved UI, animations, or anything that enhances clarity and usability.

### ‚úÖ 5. Add Improvements

- Add validation logic or error handling where needed
- Create unit tests for validator or service logic

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have **.NET 6 SDK** installed.
2. Navigate to the backend project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Backend/CryptoPriceTracker.Api
   ```
3. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. Generate your own migrations and update the database:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
5. Run the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to test the Razor page.

---

## üß™ Testing

You may add unit tests to demonstrate how you validate business logic (e.g., in the `PriceValidator` class).

---

## üí¨ Assumptions and Decisions

‚úèÔ∏è If you made any assumptions due to missing or unclear requirements, please **leave a brief comment** in the code explaining what you assumed and why.

---

## üß† Optional Architecture Upgrade

üí° You may reorganize the project structure or apply your preferred architecture (e.g., Clean Architecture, layered services, etc.)  
as long as:

- The functionality remains the same  
- The Razor page and API endpoints still work as requested  
- You document your reasoning in code comments or a note in the README

---

## üìù Notes

- üî∏ **Do not include generated migrations or database files in your submission.**
- The project uses SQLite via EF Core for simplicity.
- CoinGecko API is public and doesn't require authentication for basic price lookups.
- The crypto icon should be retrieved from the CoinGecko API.

---

## üßæ Deliverables Checklist

- [x] `CryptoPriceService.cs` fetches, saves, and avoids duplicates correctly
- [x] `namespace` declarations are consistent and correct across all files
- [x] `POST /api/crypto/update-prices` endpoint is functional

# Challenge solution

## 1. Clean Architecture for Flexibility, Maintainability & Scalability
The core of the solution is organized into concentric layers:

- **Entities (Domain Models)**  
- **Use Cases (Application Logic)**  
- **Interfaces / Adapters (API, UI, Database)**  
- **Frameworks / Infrastructure**  

By depending only inward, we ensure:
- **Flexibility:**  
  - Swap databases, UI frameworks, or third-party libraries by changing only the outer layers.  
- **Maintainability:**  
  - Each layer has a well-defined responsibility and interface, making it easy to locate and update code.  
- **Scalability:**  
  - Add new features (e.g., extra UI panels or integrations) as new adapters without touching core business logic.  

---

## 2. SOLID Principles & Single Responsibility
Every class and module adheres to SOLID:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   - Classes and methods do exactly one thing‚Äîno tangled responsibilities.  
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   - Core logic is open for extension but closed for modification.  
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   - Abstractions allow interchangeable implementations without side effects.  
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   - Clients depend only on the methods they use‚Äîno ‚Äúfat‚Äù interfaces.  
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   - High-level modules depend on abstractions, not on low-level details; dependencies are injected.  

---

## 3. DRY, YAGNI & KISS for Readability and Simplicity
- **DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself):**  
  - Shared functionality lives in utility classes or base components, eliminating duplication.  
- **YAGNI (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It):**  
  - Only implement what‚Äôs required today; resist ‚Äújust in case‚Äù features.  
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**  
  - Favor straightforward implementations that any team member can understand at a glance.  

These principles keep the codebase lean, readable, and free from unused abstractions.

---

## 4. Separation of Concerns
Responsibilities are divided across layers:

- **Domain Logic**  
  - Unaware of persistence or presentation details.  
- **Data Access**  
  - Abstracted behind repository interfaces.  
- **Presentation / UI**  
  - Handles user interaction, delegates all business decisions to the use-case layer.  

This separation yields clearer code, easier parallel development, and more targeted testing.

---

## 5. Unit Testing for Quality Assurance
Every critical component is covered by unit tests:

- **Domain Tests**  
  - Validate business rules under success and failure scenarios.  
- **Use-Case Tests**  
  - Confirm application workflows behave correctly across various scenarios.  
- **Adapter Mocks**  
  - Fake out persistence, network, or UI layers so tests remain fast and deterministic.
